# Omise's role in OMG

## Why did Omise build a _public_ network?

Logically Omise, as a payments provider trying to keep ahead of the market, needs to support any popular digital wallet platform that may emerge. Omise's business clients must be confident that their end-users' needs are met, no matter what payment method they have chosen.

Omise recognizes the need for infrastructure that nobody owns. While ostensibly, Omise could develop a centralized infrastructure for digital wallet interchange similar to existing card processors and clearinghouses, there is difficulty reaching sufficient stakeholder agreement for switching to a system around a single company.

Similar to open source software, there is significantly more incentive alignment around developing an open, decentralized system whereby participants can have assurance that they are not obligated to trust a single vendor. Research projects conducted in the Omise Blockchain Lab, which ran from 2015 to 2017, indicate strongly that this path will bring greater adoption to this platform.


## ​What will happen when the network is built? ​

Although Omise will use the network for their payments needs, **neither Omise nor OmiseGO will own or control the network once it is deployed**. It will be 100% public, owned by everyone (that is, owned by anyone participating as a network validator).

OmiseGO's long-term profit model will be a combination of validator fees through owning and staking some tokens themselves, and the aforementioned anticipated growth of Omise's payments business with network effects of the interchange network creating long-term value. OmiseGO may also provide consultancy services to companies looking to implement the OMG network (not to be confused with charging fees to access the network, which is unilaterally not a thing).
