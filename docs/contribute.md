## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the OMG Network Guide? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issue](https://github.com/OMGPool/guide/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a minimal knowledge of the project.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/OMGPool/guide/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.
