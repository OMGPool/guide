title: What is the OMG Network?

# About the OMG network

**The OMG Network is a scaling solution for finance on Ethereum, enabling transparent, peer-to-peer transactions in real-time.** The decentralized network facilitates self-sovereign financial services across geographies, asset classes, and applications.

**The OMG Network is not owned by any single one party.** Instead, it is an open distributed network of validators, and uses a blockchain to enable enforcement of market activity amongst participants.

OMG **includes a fully public, currency-agnostic decentralized exchange** (DEX) network, built to scale infinitely using the Plasma architecture, and secured by Ethereum. The OMG Network will be **able to interact with Bitcoin** (or Bitcoin-like blockchains) and other blockchain platforms through clearing houses in state channels or smart contracts, **as well as with digital fiat platforms and economies** through collateralized fiat tokens. This, in combination with virtually unlimited scalability, will **enable the OMG Network to serve essentially all global transactions simultaneously**.

OMG **offers mainstream end-customers an introduction to the many benefits of blockchain technology**. The wallet SDK will make it easy to create decentralized apps that enable end-users to interact with many blockchains, without having to leave their comfort zone.

_Please note: the OMG Network is still in development, and some details cannot yet be included. This knowledge base will be revised regularly to include updates and additional details._

## Components


### White-label Wallet Software Development Kit (SDK)

The SDK provides standardized features to digital wallet service providers (if you've ever topped up an app with money, or earned loyalty rewards on that app, it is a digital wallet). An SDK allows traditional software engineers an easy toolkit to be able to integrate the OMG network into their applications. The ultimate goal is to simplify the creation of new digital wallets to the point that software engineers will need no assistance from the OmiseGO team in order to integrate with the network.


### Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

The DEX is a scalable and secure Proof-of-Stake blockchain on which any form of digital asset can be traded. All transaction orders will be managed on the DEX chain and validated by OMG stakers (as part of the Proof-of-Stake, or PoS, consensus system), who collectively and dynamically determine the fees that are necessary to keep the network running, similar to how Ethereum or Bitcoin miners currently determine their transaction fee amounts (but without the energy waste and other objections to Proof-of-Work mining). The exchange will also be able to provide interoperability for all Ethereum tokens and for any Bitcoin (or Bitcoin-like) blockchain for fully on-chain cross-chain exchange. In summary, a DEX is needed to be able to facilitate instantaneous cross-currency value exchange.


### Scalability Network Mechanism

For an initial primer, you can read more about this in the [Basics](basics.html) section. OMG was designed for the Plasma architecture, which structures blockchain computation into MapReduce functions and uses a combination of Proof-of-Stake token bonding, fraud proofs to reduce the costs of computation, a withdrawal design to efficiently counter network attacks, and the network security provided by Ethereum as the root chain to safely enable unprecedented transaction and on-chain exchange processing speed and scale. 


### Decentralized Cash In/Out Layer

The OmiseGO digital wallet SDK allows integration with debit and credit cards for top-up and cash-out options, via ATMs or over-the-counter. The goal with cash-in and cash-out touch points is to create a network of banking, hardware, and retail partners where users can deposit and withdraw their cash. The cash becomes tokenized onto their wallet application of choice, and is immediately exchangeable for other tokenized currencies and assets via the OmiseGO blockchain. For example, you could easily convert money into in-app loyalty points, and then transfer them to a completely unrelated video game as in-game currency; all that is required is that these 3 entities are integrated onto the OMG network.
