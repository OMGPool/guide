# Cash in/out

73% of Southeast Asia is unbanked. That means a majority don’t have access to traditional banking infrastructure such as cards, loans, etc and primarily use fiat money for everything from getting paid to buying groceries.

But, everyone has a smartphone and many companies have started building “e-wallet” apps where one can walk into a convenience store, give the teller cash, and it gets loaded onto a siloed utility app to pay the monthly utility bill.

Another well-known example is the Starbucks app, although dealing with cards, it’s an example of a wallet application that money goes into but cannot get out of besides paying for coffee.

These apps all exist on a “closed loop” payment infrastructure. We want to open up these wallet siloes and have wallets exchange with each other. We believe this will make users happy and increase merchant volume.

## What is Cash in/out?

The goal with cash in and cash out touch points is to create a network of banking, hardware, and retail partners where users can deposit and withdraw their cash. The cash becomes tokenized on to their wallet application of choice, and is immediately exchangeable for other tokenized currencies and assets via the OmiseGO blockchain.

With integrated merchant mobile wallets, a decentralized exchange on a blockchain, and finally cash in / cash out touch points this fulfills the final part of our mission to unbank the banked. In addition to servicing the unbanked, what this really provides is an alternative to the current banking system. A free and open financial service network to all people, whether or not they have bank accounts.

## Current state

Our ambitions are global, OmiseGO is in active discussions with business partners and unfortunately there is not much they can publicly share yet.
