# Business Development

OmiseGO takes an integrated approach to community engagement and business development.

> "True crypto projects build communities, not consumers."

It becomes difficult to separate community engagement from business development when simultaneously creating a completely free and open source product and an N-sided marketplace. Success depends on the health of a complex ecosystem of partners and collaborators, for a product that is equally aimed at enterprise providers and individuals operating entirely free of intermediaries.

Implementing this approach, **OmiseGO has done no paid marketing** (including bounties) and provided no discounts during its crowdsale to anyone, including VCs and media groups. **Nonetheless, the OmiseGO subreddit and Twitter account have the highest subscription rates of any Ethereum project so far.**
